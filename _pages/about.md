I am currently a research assistant with the Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Lab for Enterprises (SCALE) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), working on machine learning for database systems. My supervisor is Professor. [Gao Cong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/).<br>
<br>
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in Tianjin, China, where I am a member of the institue of Big Data.

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **machine learning** (including probabilistic models and deep learning models) and its application to **database systems** and **data mining**.<br>
