I am currently a research assistant with the Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Lab for Enterprises ([SCALE](http://scale.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/default.aspx)) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), working on machine learning for database systems. My supervisor is Professor. [Gao Cong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/).<br>
<br>
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in Tianjin, China, where I was a member of [the Institue of Big Data](https://bigdata.nankai.edu.cn/).

# News
Jan/05/2021  Our paper about a unified deep cardinality estimator is accepted to SIGMOD 2021. Good moment! The paper presents an interesting solution to training deep autoregressive models from both data and queries.

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **machine learning** (including probabilistic models and deep learning models) and its application to **database systems** and **data mining**.<br>
